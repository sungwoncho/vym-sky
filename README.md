# Vym-Sky

This version does not work. It's **work in progress**.

## Work in Progress

See [https://github.com/vymio/vym](https://github.com/vymio/vym) for the code
that actually runs [vym.io](https://vym.io).

## Security

The keys committed in [settings-local.json]
(https://github.com/vymio/vym/blob/master/settings-local.json) are either dummy
or throwaway keys.

Vym never saves your code anywhere.
